# Installing Ansible

Ansible is an agentless automation tool that you install on a single host (referred to as the control node).

From the control node, Ansible can manage an entire fleet of machines and other devices (referred to as managed nodes) remotely with SSH, Powershell remoting, and numerous other transports, all from a simple command-line interface with no databases or daemons required.

## Control node requirements

For your *control* node (the machine that runs Ansible), you can use nearly any UNIX-like machine with Python installed. This includes Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, macOS, BSDs, and Windows under a [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) distribution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). Windows without WSL is not natively supported as a control node; see [Matt Davis' blog post](http://blog.rolpdog.com/2020/03/why-no-ansible-controller-for-windows.html) for more information.

## Managed node requirements

The *managed* node (the machine that Ansible is managing) does not require Ansible to be installed, but requires Python to run Ansible-generated Python code.
The managed node also needs a user account that can connect through SSH to the node with an interactive POSIX shell.


> [!NOTE]
>
> There can be exceptions in module requirements. For example, network modules do not require Python on the managed device. See documentation for the modules you use.


## Node requirement summary

You can find details about control and managed node requirements, including Python versions, for each Ansible version in the [Releases and maintenance](../_reference/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.md) and [Releases and maintenance](../_reference/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.md) sections.

## Selecting an Ansible package and version to install

Ansible's community packages are distributed in two ways:

- `ansible-core`: a minimalist language and runtime package containing a set of built-in modules and plugins.
- `ansible`: a much larger "batteries included" package, which adds a community-curated selection of [Ansible Collections](../collections_guide/index.md) for automating a wide variety of devices.

Choose the package that fits your needs.
The following instructions use `ansible` as a package name, but you can substitute `ansible-core` if you prefer to start with the minimal package and separately install only the Ansible Collections you require.

The `ansible` or `ansible-core` packages may be available in your operating systems package manager, and you are free to install these packages with your preferred method. For more information, see the [Installing Ansible on specific operating systems](installation_distros.md) guide. These installation instructions only cover the officially supported means of installing the python packages with `pip`.

See the [Ansible package release status table](../_reference/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.md) for the `ansible-core` version included in the package.

## Installing and upgrading Ansible with pipx

On some systems, it may not be possible to install Ansible with `pip`, due to decisions made by the operating system developers. In such cases, `pipx` is a widely available alternative.

These instructions will not go over the steps to install `pipx`; if those instructions are needed, please continue to the [pipx installation instructions](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/#install-pipx) for more information.

### Installing Ansible

Use `pipx` in your environment to install the full Ansible package:

``` console
$ pipx install --include-deps ansible
```

You can install the minimal `ansible-core` package:

``` console
$ pipx install ansible-core
```

Alternately, you can install a specific version of `ansible-core`:

``` console
$ pipx install ansible-core==2.12.3
```

### Upgrading Ansible

To upgrade an existing Ansible installation to the latest released version:

``` console
$ pipx upgrade --include-injected ansible
```

### Installing Extra Python Dependencies

To install additional python dependencies that may be needed, with the example of installing the `argcomplete` python package as described below:

``` console
$ pipx inject ansible argcomplete
```

Include the `--include-apps` option to make apps in the additional python dependency available on your PATH. This allows you to execute commands for those apps from the shell.

``` console
$ pipx inject --include-apps ansible argcomplete
```

If you need to install dependencies from a requirements file, for example when installing the Azure collection, you can use `runpip`.

``` console
$ pipx runpip ansible install -r ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/azure/azcollection/requirements.txt
```

## Installing and upgrading Ansible with pip

### Locating Python

Locate and remember the path to the Python interpreter you wish to use to run Ansible. The following instructions refer to this Python as `python3`.
For example, if you have determined that you want the Python at `/usr/bin/python3.9` to be the one that you will install Ansible under, specify that instead of `python3`.

### Ensuring `pip` is available

To verify whether `pip` is already installed for your preferred Python:

``` console
$ python3 -m pip -V
```

If all is well, you should see something like the following:

``` console
$ python3 -m pip -V
pip 21.0.1 from /usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pip (python 3.9)
```

If so, `pip` is available, and you can move on to the [next step](intro_installation.md).

If you see an error like `No module named pip`, you will need to install `pip` under your chosen Python interpreter before proceeding.
This may mean installing an additional OS package (for example, `python3-pip`), or installing the latest `pip` directly from the Python Packaging Authority by running the following:

``` console
$ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
$ python3 get-pip.py --user
```

You may need to perform some additional configuration before you are able to run Ansible. See the Python documentation on [installing to the user site](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-to-the-user-site) for more information.

### Installing Ansible

Use `pip` in your selected Python environment to install the full Ansible package for the current user:

``` console
$ python3 -m pip install --user ansible
```

You can install the minimal `ansible-core` package for the current user:

``` console
$ python3 -m pip install --user ansible-core
```

Alternately, you can install a specific version of `ansible-core`:

``` console
$ python3 -m pip install --user ansible-core==2.12.3
```

### Upgrading Ansible

To upgrade an existing Ansible installation in this Python environment to the latest released version, simply add `--upgrade` to the command above:

``` console
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user ansible
```

## Installing Ansible to containers

Instead of installing Ansible content manually, you can simply build an execution environment container image or use one of the available community images as your control node.
See [Getting started with Execution Environments](../getting_started_ee/index.md) for details.

## Installing for development

If you are testing new features, fixing bugs, or otherwise working with the development team on changes to the core code, you can install and run the source from GitHub.


> [!NOTE]
>
> You should only install and run the `devel` branch if you are modifying `ansible-core` or trying out features under development. This is a rapidly changing source of code and can become unstable at any point.


For more information on getting involved in the Ansible project, see the ansible_community_guide.

For more information on creating Ansible modules and Collections, see the developer_guide.

### Installing `devel` from GitHub with `pip`

You can install the `devel` branch of `ansible-core` directly from GitHub with `pip`:

``` console
$ python3 -m pip install --user https://github.com/ansible/ansible/archive/devel.tar.gz
```

You can replace `devel` in the URL mentioned above, with any other branch or tag on GitHub to install older versions of Ansible, tagged alpha or beta versions, and release candidates.

### Running the `devel` branch from a clone

`ansible-core` is easy to run from source. You do not need `root` permissions to use it and there is no software to actually install. No daemons or database setup are required.

1.  Clone the `ansible-core` repository

    ``` console
    $ git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git
    $ cd ./ansible
    ```

2.  Setup the Ansible environment

    - Using Bash

      ``` console
      $ source ./hacking/env-setup
      ```

    - Using Fish

      ``` console
      $ source ./hacking/env-setup.fish
      ```

    - To suppress spurious warnings/errors, use `-q`

      ``` console
      $ source ./hacking/env-setup -q
      ```

3.  Install Python dependencies

    ``` console
    $ python3 -m pip install --user -r ./requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Update the `devel` branch of `ansible-core` on your local machine

    Use pull-with-rebase so any local changes are replayed.

    ``` console
    $ git pull --rebase
    ```

## Confirming your installation

You can test that Ansible is installed correctly by checking the version:

``` console
$ ansible --version
```

The version displayed by this command is for the associated `ansible-core` package that has been installed.

To check the version of the `ansible` package that has been installed:

``` console
$ ansible-community --version
```

## Adding Ansible command shell completion

You can add shell completion of the Ansible command line utilities by installing an optional dependency called `argcomplete`. It supports bash, and has limited support for zsh and tcsh.

For more information about installation and configuration, see the [argcomplete documentation](https://kislyuk.github.io/argcomplete/).

### Installing `argcomplete`

If you chose the `pipx` installation instructions:

``` console
$ pipx inject --include-apps ansible argcomplete
```

If you chose the `pip` installation instructions:

``` console
$ python3 -m pip install --user argcomplete
```

### Configuring `argcomplete`

There are 2 ways to configure `argcomplete` to allow shell completion of the Ansible command line utilities: globally or per command.

#### Global configuration

Global completion requires bash 4.2.

``` console
$ activate-global-python-argcomplete --user
```

This will write a bash completion file to a user location. Use `--dest` to change the location or `sudo` to set up the completion globally.

#### Per command configuration

If you do not have bash 4.2, you must register each script independently.

``` console
$ eval $(register-python-argcomplete ansible)
$ eval $(register-python-argcomplete ansible-config)
$ eval $(register-python-argcomplete ansible-console)
$ eval $(register-python-argcomplete ansible-doc)
$ eval $(register-python-argcomplete ansible-galaxy)
$ eval $(register-python-argcomplete ansible-inventory)
$ eval $(register-python-argcomplete ansible-playbook)
$ eval $(register-python-argcomplete ansible-pull)
$ eval $(register-python-argcomplete ansible-vault)
```

You should place the above commands into your shell's profile file such as `~/.profile` or `~/.bash_profile`.

#### Using `argcomplete` with zsh or tcsh

See the [argcomplete documentation](https://kislyuk.github.io/argcomplete/).
